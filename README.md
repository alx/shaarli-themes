## Shaarli-themes
A collection of themes/stylesheets for [Shaarli](https://github.com/sebsauvage/Shaarli).  
This repository is a work in progress, use at your own risk (see [issue 3](https://github.com/shaarli/shaarli-themes/issues/3))  
The long term goal is to provide a collection of default themes for Shaarli, see [issue 22](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/issues/22)
